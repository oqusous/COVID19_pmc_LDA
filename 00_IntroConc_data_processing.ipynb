The huge increase in testing has put pressure on the laboratory supply chain and resulted in shortages of viral transport media. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended the use of alternative viral transport media, such as liquid Amies, saline, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Further recommendations suggest that specimens can be stored for up to 72 h at 4°C or frozen at no more than −70°C for longer storage (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2; accessed 2 April 2020).

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection and mild upper respiratory tract illness in the majority of patients, to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death (2–4). Initial indications are that older adults and people with serious underlying health conditions are at greatest risk for severe illness (5–7). Host immune system responses may be one of the most important determinants for disease progression and outcome.\n",

      "The virus causing COVID-19 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus (genus Betacoronavirus) together with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and has been designated SARS-CoV-2 (8). Coronaviruses contain four structural proteins, including spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The spike surface glycoprotein, which contains RBD, plays a major role in viral attachment, fusion of viral and host membranes, and entry of the virus into host cells and is a determinant of host range and tissue tropism (9). SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds strongly to human ACE2 receptors (1, 10), and is likely an important target for virus neutralizing antibodies. The highly immunogenic spike protein or RBD alone are therefore targets of interest for the development of serological and neutralization assays. Serological surveillance is of critical public health importance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence, death rate, and the eventual development of herd immunity, as well as to identify potential donors of convalescent plasma for therapeutic use (11). Virus-specific antibodies develop within 1 to 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset and can also aid in diagnosis of infections in those for whom reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory tract specimens for viral RNA is negative (12).\n",

More limited serological testing provided data for IgM and IgG responses to RBD in an additional 86 outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA isotype responses show distinct time courses and variation with antigen type and are strongly associated with the clinical severity of infection. Increasing quantities of antibodies in the blood, which showed increasing ACE2 receptor blocking activity, were negatively correlated with viral RNAemia. Outpatients and asymptomatic individuals have particularly short-lived plasma antibody responses, decreasing after the first month of documented infection.\n",

      "Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its subsequently named disease (COVID-19) has raised concerns regarding the availability of hospital beds and healthcare resources throughout the international community. As of June 14, 2020, the World Health Organization has reported over seven million confirmed cases and over four hundred thousand deaths in 216 countries [1]. In response, most healthcare systems have prioritised the conservation of disposable and non-disposable resources, with further efforts aimed at maintaining a low hospital census. This has largely been borne out of a necessity to free up resources for potential surges in COVID-19 admissions and the goal of minimising nosocomial viral transmission.\n",

      "The COVID-19 outbreak has also had a significant impact on the orthopaedic community. Many local and state governments placed a moratorium on elective surgical procedures, thereby limiting surgery to patients that were deemed to have a serious medical illness, needed surgery to preserve life or limb(s), and those who without timely intervention would suffer serious adverse medical consequences [2]. Regarding orthopaedic trauma care, surgical fracture treatment is generally considered an essential surgical intervention under these criteria [3]. Thus, ethical considerations demand that patients with acute fractures continue to require hospital admission and timely surgical management. Yet, orthopaedic surgeons must also grapple with the socioeconomic impact of their decisions and continue to explore opportunities for minimising hospital admission and utilisation of healthcare resources [4]. While in most situations, traumatic fracture care inevitably requires inpatient management, there are subsets of patients who may be treated through an outpatient approach. Specifically, blanket inpatient admissions for traumatic closed ankle fractures has recently been called into question, with some studies showing increased cost-savings and improved outcomes with targeted outpatient treatment [5–9]. In the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, outpatient surgery for ankle fractures is a potentially valuable tool, as it may minimise the risk of nosocomial spread to other vulnerable patients or frontline healthcare workers [10–12]. Moreover, the prevalence of COVID-19 in the orthopaedic trauma population may be nine times higher than that of the general population, according to a recent study by Hernigou et al. [13]. Outpatient surgery also has the potential to control allocation of finite resources, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital beds, and human resources [5–9, 14].\n",

The purpose of this study was to share our years-long experience with outpatient surgical fixation of traumatic closed ankle fractures, and to report on the outcomes for these patients. We hypothesize that outpatient surgery for ankle fractures is associated with low rates of readmission and post-operative complications.\n",

Patients that meet criteria 1-3, but exhibit a PaO2/FiO2 ratio >200 and <300 are defined as having acute lung injury (ALI), a process physiopathologically similar to ARDS but of lesser clinical severity.[4] Table 1 presents the three most commonly used definitions.\n",

By June 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert due to rapid spread of the virus [2]. By August 2009, over 254,206 cases worldwide had been reported, resulting in 2,837 deaths. Given that countries are no longer required to report individual cases, it is highly probable that the reported cases represent an underestimation of the actual incidence of this disease [3]. In contrast to seasonal influenza, mortality from Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 appears worse in infants and young adults and those with morbid obesity. In addition, pregnant women appear to be at higher risk of mortality [3, 4].

      "Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) is a viral disease that causes acute diarrhoea, dehydration, and a high mortality rate in suckling piglets. The virus responsible for PED (PEDV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (Carstens, 2010). Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea was first described in Europe (UK) in 1971 (Wood, 1977) and subsequently spread to other European countries (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978). In the 80's and 90's, PED epidemics became infrequent in Europe (Nagy, Nagy, Meder, & Mocsari, 1996; Pijpers, van Nieuwstadt, Terpstra, & Verheijden, 1993; Pritchard, Paton, Wibberley, & Ibata, 1999), while severe epidemics were reported in some Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea (Kweon et al., 1993; Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983). In Thailand in 2007–2008 and in China in 2010–2012, severe PED outbreaks were reported (Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Since May 2013, PED has become an epidemic in the USA (Stevenson et al., 2013), causing huge economic losses in swine production. Distinct viral strains have been identified in the USA. The highly virulent PEDV strain associated with severe outbreaks (Stevenson et al., 2013) is called “US original” or “non‐S‐INDEL”, in reference to the S‐INDEL, which shows minimal to no clinical signs (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014b) and is characterized by insertions and deletions in the spike (S) gene. Additionally, another coronavirus, genetically distinct from PEDV and similar to that detected in Hong Kong in 2011 (Woo et al., 2012), has been identified. This virus, called Porcine Delta Coronavirus (PDCoV), (Marthaler et al., 2014) has been found with a relatively high viral load, often in association with PEDV in farms experiencing acute diarrhoea in sows and piglets (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a).\n",

      "In Italy, PED has been present since the early 90s, and its spread has been increasing as infections caused by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, TGEV) decreases. After the severe epidemic of 2005–2006 (Martelli et al., 2008), sporadic outbreaks, characterized by mild symptoms and mortality rates slightly above the average, have occurred from 2007 to 2014 (Boniotti et al., 2016). A high level of genetic variability was observed among the strains circulating in Italy during that period (Boniotti et al., 2016). In particular, a novel coronavirus generated by recombination between PEDV and TGEV, called Swine Enteric Coronavirus (SeCoV), was identified. SeCoV was circulating in Italy from 2009 to 2012, was found in Germany (Akimkin et al., 2016) in 2012, and has recently been detected in Central Eastern Europe (Belsham et al., 2016). In July 2014, two new cases of PED, with mild clinical signs, were reported (Boniotti et al., 2016). Based on the S1 gene sequence, these new strains have a high identity with the American strain S‐INDEL OH851, which is defined as being less virulent. Since the end of 2014, PED has also been reported in Belgium (Theuns et al., 2015), Germany (Hanke et al., 2015), the Netherlands (Van Wolf et al., 2015), France (Grasland et al., 2015), Spain (EFSA, 2016), Slovenia (Toplak et al., 2016), Austria (Steinrigl et al., 2015), and Portugal (Mesquita et al., 2015), and strains genetically related to the American S‐INDEL strain have been identified in all of these countries. However, the virulent American prototype strain has only been identified in the Ukraine (Dastjerdi, Carr, Ellis, Steinbach, & Williamson, 2015).\n",

Pig transportation is often the main suspected source of PEDV infection, and thus, it can play a role in the transmission of PEDV to different herds (EFSA, 2016; Lowe et al., 2014). For the control and prevention of the disease, management, biosecurity and/or cleaning and disinfection measures should be adopted. Indeed, particular attention should be paid to the cleaning of transportation trucks, and the efficacy of decontamination procedures needs to be periodically monitored and verified.\n",

      "This commentary aims to synthesize the challenges retailers are facing during the COVID-19 emergency from the perspective of both consumers and managers. The goal is to provide guidelines on and examples of how retailers can handle this unprecedented situation. At the time of writing, the UK and many EU countries have placed large parts of their economies in lockdown in the hope of reducing deaths by an order of magnitude but with substantial negative consequences in terms of damage to national economies, businesses and individual jobs (Parker, Pickard, Cookson, & Pickford, 2020). Estimates of the negative economic effects of the crisis are at an early stage for many countries but are known to be substantial, even devastating for some emerging economies (Evans, 2020). For China, which is a couple of months or so further down the road than other countries, the economy is estimated (as of March 2020) to have taken a 3.2 percent hit in 2020 (Fernandes, 2020). For the US, a recent (March 2020) forecast is that GDP growth will decline by 2.9 percent by the end of 2020 under a 1.5-month containment strategy (Fernandes, 2020), although variation across the country is high (Makridis & Hartley, 2020). Fernandes (2020) estimates that most countries’ GDP growth is likely to decline by three to five percent in 2020 in an event of a mild (1.5 months) lockdown. Every extra month of shutdown accounts for a further two to 2.5 percent of global GDP growth. Service sectors such as retail (Fernandes, 2020), hospitality and tourism will be particularly hard hit (Dolnicar & Zare, 2020; Fernandes, 2020). More service-oriented economies will be particularly negatively affected, and have more jobs at risk (Fernandes, 2020). Countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain that are more reliant on tourism (more than 15% of GDP) will be more affected by this crisis, perhaps even losing 10 percent of GDP growth (Fernandes, 2020). Five million people in China lost their jobs in the first two months of 2020, likely to grow to more than nine million before the end of 2020, and retail sales fell by 20 percent over the same period (Fernandes, 2020). A global recession appears to be inevitable (Fernandes, 2020). Indications from China are that return to normality may be accompanied by a rebound (sharp rise) in consumption, as a result of consumers’ needs to restore their normal levels of psychological arousal in retail settings although this rebound might be limited to a very short term effect (Deng, Wang, & Chao, 2020).\n",

      "Most large companies have a part to play in supporting national economies and consumer wellbeing (Fadel, Salomon, & Descatha, 2020). All retailers strive to provide an excellent service to maintain existing and attract new consumers. However, being able to do so in a time of uncertainty and now imminent recession is harder and more complex than usual (Tarki, Levy, & Weiss, 2020). Sudden disruption of consumer demand (such as panic buying of staples such as toilet tissue and pasta, as seen in the UK) leads to negative impacts on supply chain performance (Ivanov, 2020). Extant literature has sparsely investigated the impact of emergency (e.g., a virus in some regions of Asia as the SARS SARS-CoV spread started in 2003 (Zhang, Gu, & Kavanaugh, 2005), crisis situations (Gummesson, 2009, Schenker-Wicki et al., 2010), and natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes (Rittichainuwata & Chakraborty, 2012)).

As a consequence of the extraordinary containment measures, consumers are, of course, shopping differently. The “scarcity effect” (Hamilton et al., 2019) has dramatically impacted price elasticities and stockpiling habits, while traditional deterrents such as waiting times and perceived crowding are now tolerated, as witnessed by long queues to enter stores. Several grocery retailers are diffusing messages about the availability of food and limiting the number of items to buy per consumer, implementing new types of online services, and home delivery, though often with unsatisfactory results for consumers’ sense of wellbeing. Similarly, also many online grocery stores introduced the virtual queue to limit the number of customers to be handled simultaneously (as in the case of Ocado in UK) and provide priority delivery slots for vulnerable or elderly customers (e.g. Waitrose in the UK).\n",

      "The profound changes that are being experienced at a global level are challenging consumers’ perceptions and behaviors in retailing to the extent that they might leave a mark even when the emergency is over. First, consumers might switch from the retailers they usually patronize to other competitors, because of spatial proximity reasons or because of assortment (un)availability during the emergency made them reconsider their established habits. Second, it might happen that consumers could keep patronizing after the emergency those retailers that helped them during the emergency and could develop attachment toward those stores (and reduce attachment towards others perceived not to have helped, for example those unable or unwilling to provide delivery slots for previously-loyal customers). Third, as consumers review their shopping habits, they discover benefits from services they had never used before. For instance, elderly consumers are switching to online purchases, that they never considered before, discovering the safety and benefits of home-deliveries, store pick-up, and cashless payment. Indeed, in this emergency scenario, online shopping and home deliveries have been classified as “essential services” by several governments.\n",

      "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is highly contagious and often causes a fatal disease (classical swine fever (CSF)), previously referred to as hog cholera, in susceptible pigs of all ages. The epidemic of CSF always leads to devastating financial losses, especially in a high pig density area, so it is classified as an Office International des Epizooties (OIE) List A disease. European Union (EU) pursues a straightforward, non-vaccination policy via stamping out suspected and infected herds since there is no efficient anti-CSFV vaccines (de Smit et al., 2001). However, this policy is disputed because in 1997 in the Netherlands outbreaks of CSF brought total financial consequences of US$ 2.3 billion for combating the major CSF epizootic (Meuwissen et al., 1999). In the future, controlling CSF outbreaks might be based on therapy. At the same time, CSFV shows greater similarity in genome structure and RNA synthesis strategy to hepaciviruses than to flaviviruses (Lindenbach and Rice, 2001). Because hepaciviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture, CSFV, a normative representative in pestiviruses, has been used as a model system for studying hepaciviruses. So there is an urgent need to develop infection mechanism and antiviral research about CSFV.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "CSFV belongs to the genus pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000). Like other members of the family, including the genus flavivirus and the genus hepacivirus, pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses containing a positive single-strand RNA genome. The CSFV genome of about 12.5 kbp contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding for a polyprotein of approximately 4000 amino acids and initiating at an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The polyprotein is processed into a total of 12 viral structural and non-structural proteins. The gene product order along the ORF is NH2–Npro–C–Erns–E1–E2–p7–NS2–NS3–NS4A–NS4B–NSA–NS5B–COOH (Rice, 1996). The 5′-UTR contains the IRES for cap-independent translation of the viral polyprotein (Rijnbrand et al., 1997; Fletcher and Jackson, 2002), the 3′-UTR may contain replication signals involved in minus-strand RNA synthesis (Yu et al., 1999). Non-structural proteins are speculated to be components in the viral replication cycle. Replication of CSFV genome proceeds in two steps: synthesis of complementary minus-strand RNA using the genome as template and the subsequent synthesis of genomic RNA using this minus-strand RNA template. The key enzyme involved in both of these steps is a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This viral protein (non-structural protein 5B (NS5B)), which is located at the extreme C-terminus of the polyprotein, contains motifs shared by RdRps, such as the Gly–Asp–Asp (GAA) motif, which is highly conserved among RdRps (Koonin, 1991) and has been demonstrated to possess RdRp activity. CSFV RdRp is able to initiate replication de novo without the requirement for protein or nucleic acid primers (Kao and Sun, 1996, Kao et al., 1999, Kao et al., 2001).\n",

      "Sequence alignments of viral RNA-directed polymerase (reverse transcriptases and RdRps) have identified several conserved sequence motifs that are important for biological functions and shared among these enzymes. Now the data of crystal structures of RdRps from different RNA viruses can be acquired, including reovirus (Tao et al., 2002), calicivirus (Ng et al., 2002), poliovirus (Hansen et al., 1997), Φ6 (Butcher et al., 2001) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Ago et al., 1999, Bressanelli et al., 2002). Those studies have elucidated for key aspects of the structural biology of RdRps and confirmed the hypothesis that RdRps share a common architecture and mechanism of polymerase catalysis (Kamer and Argos, 1984). So, we can make the CSFV RdRp protein tertiary structure model based on the homology-modeling method by using these data to get the deeper and wider information of RdRp.\n",

Moreover, the success obtained with polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of viral infections of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV provide a basis for designing a reasonable antiviral drug.

      "The work presented here includes expressing, purifying and functional analysis of a recombinant NS5BΔ24 fusion protein from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The fusion protein was demonstrated to have the ability to initiate de novo either plus- or minus-strand viral RNA synthesis in a primer-independent manner and to specifically interact with viral RNA templates. In order to understand the structural basis of RdRp enzymatic activity and potential drug susceptibility, we also compared the sequence of CSFV polymerase with those of HIV-1, reovirus, calicivirus, poliovirus, Φ6 and HCV polymerases, situated in the conserved sequence motifs that are shared among RdRps. In respect that CSFV shows great similarity in genome structure and RNA synthesis strategy to hepaciviruses and there are prolific structural and biochemical data on HCV polymerase, we built a three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of CSFV RNA polymerase based on the conserved motifs in RdRps and HCV polymerase crystal structures. The validity of the model developed in the present study is supported by its ability to explain some of the key biochemical data. Analyzing conformational changes of the model and roles of the specific residues in the polymerization mechanism, we addressed some results which are likely to provide guidance in the design of future biochemical experiments and aid the development of anti-CSFV agents.\n",

These secondary metabolites are acknowledged to provide a rich pool for exploring novel compounds that may be exploited commercially in various industries (Manach et al. 2013). Many of these compounds found in Licorice roots (Glycyrrhiza glabra/Glycyrrhiza uralensis) have received attention in the recent years owing to their multitude of biological activities (Asl and Hosseinzadeh 2008).

      "Since almost all the licorice root used in mercantile, is collected from wild resources, therefore, its high demand and low supply has invited establishing alternative systems for production in renewable resources. However, selection of highly productive lines and optimization of chemical and physical culture milieu of the cells for copious production is a prerequisite for the commercial application of these systems. It has been demonstrated that the biosynthetic activity of cultured cells can be enhanced by regulating various factors like environment (Ayabe et al. 1990), selecting hyper–producing lines (Jiao et al. 2014; Mardamshin et al. 1994) precursor feeding (Yang et al. 2007a, 2010) and transformation method (Li et al. 2013). The expanding commercial importance of the plant based anti-cancer compound has kindled the researchers to look for their production in tissue culture system. Exploitation of the biosynthetic capabilities of different cell types under a defined set of parameters, would not only give higher yields of the desired compound but will also provide deeper insight into regulatory processes thereon. Various in vitro systems including callus, organ (Gupta et al. 2013), cell suspension (Yang et al. 2006, 2007b) root (Du et al. 2001) and shoot cultures (Kojoma et al. 2010), have been exploited and subjected to terpenoid and flavonoid investigations in the past. In-vitro culture based metabolite analyses have shown the presence of flavonoids, chalcones and isoflavonoids (Kobayashi et al. 1985). Flavonoids like formononetin, isoliquiritigenin, echinatin, glabridine (Man et al. 2012; Tamura and Oda 1996), liquiritigenin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, 3′-hydroxy formononetin have been reported from the in vitro culture lines of Glycyrrhiza species. A recent study on adventitious roots of G. uralensis revealed production of flavonoids at par with the intact plant (Wang et al. 2013). Similar results on flavonoid hyper-producing cultures were reported by (Man et al. 2013) in suspended cells of Glycyrrhiza. However, reports on oleanane-type triterpenoids (glycyrrhizin and glycyrritinic acid) are few and recent (Gupta et al. 2013; Shirazi et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2006). On the contrary, lupane type triterpenoids (betulinic acid) and soya saponins, have been found in most of the earlier studies pertaining to tissue culture raised plants (Hayashi et al. 1988), exhibiting metabolite distribution pattern in various organs of the in vitro plant (Hayashi et al. 1988). Literature survey revealed most of the studies on terpenoids and flavonoids detection in in vitro plant cultures remain restricted to few compounds (Hayashi et al. 1988; Yang et al. 2007b), restraining a comprehensive picture of the metabolite composition. Until now, only a single report on the chemical analysis of six flavonoids and two terpenoids in suspension cells of G. uralensis has been accounted (Man et al. 2013). Here we are reporting the simultaneous assessment of ten compounds-eight flavonoids (butin, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, glabridin, 4′-O-methylglabridine, hispaglabridin A and hispaglabridin B) and two terpenoids (glycyrrhizin and 18α-glycyrritinic acid) in the licorice root and in vitro raised callus, organ culture and plantlets of G. glabra. Also, the in vitro cytotoxicity, against a panel of four human cancer cell lines, were evaluated for these samples. The present study broadens the concept to investigate the biosynthetic potential of in vitro raised G. glabra cultures.\n",

The single protein expressed on the surface of filoviruses, the glycoprotein (GP), is antigenically and immunologically important and is frequently therapeutically targeted. However, bioinformatics analysis, at the structure-based and amino acid level, demarcates limited regions of homology in GP [4] and also large areas of divergence particularly in the head domain of GP.

Indications from experimental infection of vaccinated non-human primates suggest a role for GP-specific IgG and CD8+ T cells [5,6], and the limited analyses of convalescent samples suggest that the presence of Ebola virus-specific IgG and intact cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are associated with survival from natural infection [7–9].

      "EVD vaccine development has been well established since the discovery of Ebola virus and a number of different vaccine platforms have been used, resulting in at least one efficacious vaccine. These vaccine platforms include DNA, recombinant or subunit proteins, virus-like particles (VLPs) and recombinant viral vectors. A number of these vaccines have advanced past pre-clinical testing and are undergoing clinical testing; generally, those modalities that have demonstrated efficacy or high levels of immunogenicity in pre-clinical models. The most clinically advanced vaccines against EVD are based on generating immune responses toward GP with trials ongoing in Europe, the USA and Africa. There are eight vaccines in clinical trials, all targeting the Ebola virus GP, with some regimens employing a single dose and others using two vaccines in a heterologous prime-boost approach. Prime-boost regimens have been shown to be more immunogenic than single-dose vaccinations for diseases such as malaria; however, there are financial and logistical implications associated with administering two vaccines [11]. The Ebola virus vaccines that are currently being assessed differ in the qualitative immune response post-vaccination, which may be due to the use of alternate vaccine platforms. Indeed, while humoral immunity may be critical for protection post vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-vectored vaccines in non-human primates (NHPs), CMI may be key post single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines [12]. As both humoral and cellular immunity have been demonstrated to be protective in NHP, and are induced in man post-EBOV infection, a vaccine regimen which induces long-lived and sustainable levels of CMI and antibodies is desirable. Primarily, and finally, only those vaccines that are safe, efficacious and deployable will be field-effective, therefore only vaccine candidates that have progressed to published Phase I studies will be reviewed here. Clinical trials where results were published in peer-reviewed journals by July 2016 are summarized in table 1.\n",

As of June 20, 2020, approximately 8,525,042 cases have been confirmed worldwide, and 456,973 deaths have occurred [4].\n",

      "The main manifestation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory infection, and the renal, cardiovascular, digestive, blood and nervous systems may be simultaneously involved [5,6]. According to a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the case-fatality rate was 2.3% in 44,672 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19, and all cases of death involved critical patients [7]. Therefore, the identification of predictors of severe infection and mortality is essential for guiding clinical treatment and intervention.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most important complications of COVID-19 [8]. According to the definition of AKI by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, the incidence of AKI in hospitalized Chinese adults was 11.6% and rose to 50% for those in the intensive care unit (ICU), indicating that the incidence of COVID-19-induced AKI is highly variable to date[[9], [10], [11]]. Currently, several studies have shown that the fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with AKI is incredibly high, ranging from 8% to 23% [12,13]. A previous study indicated that 6.7% of patients with SARS might develop AKI, and the mortality rate of those with AKI is 91.7%[14,15]. This finding indicates that clinicians must pay more attention to COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI. The development of AKI in COVID-19 patients is a critical prognostic factor for survival, but, unlike other known prognostic factors, AKI is possibly curable by interventions. In this article, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the correlation between AKI and disease severity and fatality in patients with COVID-19 and to provide reliable evidence for improving the treatment and control of COVID-19.\n",

      "Foodborne diseases are increasingly treating worldwide because of industrial globalization and an ever-increasing urban population that has resulted in a massive demand for the food supply and have led to compromise on food quality. To prevent this, detection of possible contaminants through routine controls in every stage of the food supply is highly critical. In this context, all kinds of food safety issues, including those originated from physical, biological and chemical factors related to hygiene issues, as well as illegal adulterations and unauthorized additives, needs to be carefully monitored by means of highly sensitive analytical devices that are more practical than precise liquid or gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry, which are laboratory controlled, cumbersome, complex, costly and require well trained operators [1]. Among all the instrumental and manual laboratory-based analytical approaches, biosensors are the best candidates as sensitive technologies that can be substituted for traditional approaches, having better sensitivity and selectivity, especially when integrated with advances in nanotechnology and unique achievements of biotechnology.\n",

      "Since the first introduction of the exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure in 1990, aptamers have emerged as high-affinity oligonucleotides with many unique features and have been combined with many separations and analytical devices and been employed in various areas of medical and pharmaceutical basic researches, drug development, disease diagnosis, and delivery of therapeutics [2]. High selective binding aptamers as single stranded oligonucleotides with a remarkable role in biotechnology can be either DNA or RNA based, which are isolated from a huge library of randomised oligonucleotides during consecutive cycles of incubation with the target, partitioning and amplification [3]. Aptamers have proved high potential to be replaced for antibodies in biosensor development as the biorecognition elements, because of offering several advantages over antibodies, such as better stability, simple storage, in vitro synthesis, low cost, easy modification and remarkably high affinity. Meanwhile, their smaller size makes them preferential for miniaturised systems as they can form a dense surface coverage of monolayers, which are also capable of being recycled upon breaking the aptamer-target complex, which is not normally possible with antibodies [4]. In addition, many food contaminants include substances that do not induce antibody generation, here aptamers remain to be an almost ideal option as highly selective, resistant and cost-effective option for biosensing [5]. Aptamers can recognise a vast variety of targets owing to their three-dimensional folding and adaptive conformational switching and being flexible for different modifications. Accordingly, it has gained extensive interest for food safety monitoring, and numerous aptasensors based on different transduction pathways have been designed in last decades for determination of the wide scope of biological and chemical substances. Recently, remarkable attempts have been made to improve several aspects of them, including selectivity (blended-SELEX, counter-SELEX, and negative-SELEX) and the selection time during SELEX procedure (automated-SELEX) [6].\n",

      "In the late winter of 2019, emergence of the SARS-COV-2 virus led to the COVID-19 pandemic, manifesting in a serious illness affecting over a million people around the world, including the United States, during the spring of 2020 [1]. During this pandemic, people with preexisting medical conditions are at higher risk of severe, potentially life-threatening effects of SARS CoV2 infection [2]. Not only is there the likelihood of increased morbidity and mortality if these individuals become infected with the virus, but the social and economic consequences of COVID-19 may significantly impact their access to critical healthcare resources. Among individuals with rare diseases, the implications of the pandemic may be unique, and can present specific management challenges. Moreover, the pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to research aspects related to immunity, lysosomal dysfunction and disease pathogenesis in distinct rare disease communities which will ultimately enhance clinical care. A group of investigators and physician experts in Gaucher disease along with patient advocacy organizations in the United States convened to propose management guidelines and to identify research questions during these challenging times. The overarching goal of this collaborative group is to delineate the emerging impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on patients with Gaucher disease and to develop optimal clinical practice guidelines for managing the infection.\n",

      "Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by recessively inherited homozygous or biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase, acid β-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.45). These variants lead to varying degrees of deficient and/or defective glucocerebrosidase function, and the lysosomal accumulation of excess glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside, Gb1), glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), and other sphingolipids [3,4]. GD is among the most common lysosomal diseases affecting approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals. However, in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, the frequency is much higher, affecting as many as 1 in 850 individuals. The disease is characterized by vast phenotypic heterogeneity and is classically divided into non-neuronopathic (type 1, GD1) and neuronopathic types (GD2 and GD3). These variants share the common feature of major systemic macrophage involvement, manifesting with varying degrees of hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia and bone disease. There is accumulation of glycosphingolipid-laden macrophages (“Gaucher cells”) in the spleen, liver, lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues, and somewhat infrequently, in the lung or kidney [4,5]. A subset of patients, especially those that have undergone prior splenectomy for hypersplenism, develop pulmonary vascular disease manifesting as pulmonary hypertension or hepatopulmonary syndrome. Additionally, in GD1 there are age-related phenotypes in a small subset of patients that can include gammopathy/myeloma, other hematological malignancies and certain solid organ malignancies [6]. The neuronopathic forms have a spectrum of brain involvement, ranging from a rapidly progressive lethal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy (GD2) to more indolent and variable CNS involvement with eye movement abnormalities (gaze palsy), a hallmark neurological manifestation (GD3) [7]. A subset of patients with GD, as well as their heterozygous carrier relatives, have an increased life-time risk of developing Parkinson's disease, although the complete mechanism underlying this association is not fully delineated [8]. The degree of clinical heterogeneity in GD is remarkable, and can be viewed as a continuum of phenotypes [9]. In general, prior to treatment patients with GD have impaired macrophage function and immune dysregulation involving multiple myeloid cell lineages leading to chronic metabolic inflammation [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Additionally, some patients had splenectomies performed before the advent of therapy, and others harbor immunological abnormalities [15]. Together, these factors could portend poor outcome when patients with GD encounter infectious disease.\n",

      "Since being introduced roughly two centuries ago for smallpox, vaccines have significantly contributed to human health as one of the most effective tools in preventing and treating fatal diseases. Traditionally, either whole inactivated or live attenuated microorganisms are injected, however, this method sometimes leads to side effects that range from mild to unacceptable. Recently, purified or recombinated macromolecules of pathogens, such as surface proteins or polysaccharides, have been used increasingly in clinical trials to minimize the possible side effects. As additional knowledge of the workings of the immune system on a molecular level is acquired, more efforts can be directed towards the development of highly efficient but safe vaccines for diseases such as AIDS and cancers that have previously eluded treatment via vaccination [1], [2], [3]. Cancer immunotherapy has been identified as one of the most plausible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery as it possesses many unique advantages. These include highly specific delivery to targeted cells, memory to pre-immuned diseases, and simple administrations (e.g., injection, inhalation of aerosol vaccine, and skin patch) [4]. As more detailed information of the mechanism of the disease becomes available, the delivery of therapeutic molecules has become one of the most important targets for the development of a successful vaccination strategy.\n",

However, no universal vaccine system displaying all of these requirements has been developed thus far. To deliver antigens to phagocytic APCs, various delivery systems such as liposomes, microparticles, and nanotubes have been studied [6], [7], [8]. Using these delivery vehicles, the antigens mixed with adjuvant molecules, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have demonstrated prolonged immune responses and increased local inflammation [9].\n",

      "Once internalized, antigens are processed by either an endogenous or an exogenous pathway. Endogenous antigen-derived peptides are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which activate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response, or cellular immunity, after binding to T cell receptors. In contrast, an antibody-mediated response, also referred to as humoral immunity, is activated through exogenous antigen-derived peptide/MHC II complexes on APCs. Therefore, it is presumed that a desirable immune response can be achieved by controlling the antigen presentation pathway and cellular immune response has been reported to be more effective in removing infected cells and cancers than humoral immunity [10]. In previous studies, it has been shown that an increased MHC I antigen presentation can be achieved by priming APCs with antigen-encapsulating acid-degradable nanoparticles, which degrade at acidic pH following phagocytosis to release the antigens into the cytoplasm [11], [12], [13].\n",

History provides a record of epidemics such as plague, smallpox, measles, cholera, influenza, Ebola, AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and now COVID-19 (David, 2020). 2003 was the first known year of SARS illness caused by coronavirus in China as acute respiratory syndrome. A second outbreak was in 2012 in Saudi Arabia as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). World Health organization (WHO) in Dec 31, 2019 named it SARS-COV-2 and the disease as COVID-19 (Cui et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2020; Peiris et al., 2004; WHO, 2020).

      "World Health Organization gave the name of the disease as COVID-19 on Feb 11 2020. In the name of the disease COVID-19, CO stands for ‘Corona’, VI stands for ‘Virus’ D stands for ‘Disease’. This disease is the first time introduce in the year of 2019 that is why it is called COVID-19. Again, this virus has not previously seen in humans so it is also called “Novel corona virus”. The SAR-COV is a member of the β-coronavirus sub-group from coronaviridae family (Pyrc et al., 2007). The virus having crown like spikes on the outer surface of it that's why we called as corona virus. Its size ranging from 65 to 125 nm in diameter. The effect of the virus is an acute lung jury and respiratory distress syndrome that ultimately causes pulmonary failure and causes a fatality. The virus of COVID-19 is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets instead of air. The main spreading way of this virus is through respiratory droplets expelled by the person suffering from cold and cough. By touching these droplets present on the surface around the person with COVID-19 is a strong reason for catching this disease. So it is very important to maintain a distance of around 1 m (3 ft) away from person who is sick. The symptoms of this disease are dry cough, fever, difficulty in breathing. Infants, older people and those with medical problems like high B.P., cancer, diabetes, heart problem, asthma are more prone to develop this disease (Arabi et al., 2019; Ashour et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). As virus spreads COVID-19 so antibiotics do not work. Without much clinical experience, some already medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir, ritonavir, corticosteroids, paracetamol, ibuprofen and certain nucleotide are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 (Gautret et al., 2020; Colson et al., 2020; Zhonghua, J. H. H. H. X. Z. Z., 2020). Although there is no evidence that the above-proposed medicine can prevent or cure the disease surely. However, some traditional or home remedies may improve our resistance power for dealing with this virus. Since there is no effective antiviral medicines or vaccine is investigated until now so the most effective way to protect our self by social distancing. Social lockdown is considered the most effective measure to control COVID-19 (Das and Patial, 2020; Paital et al., 2020). The curve can be flattened by social distancing and this has been an incidental boon to the environment. So, in the throes of adversity, yet there is a reason to celebrate in COVID-19. It has been noticed that over a month in this lockdown, air and water pollution have been declined. During the lockdown period, the Ganga water quality improved remarkably. The COVID-19's gift to Ganga was seen within 10 days of nationwide lockdown. As per the data of the Central pollution control board (CPCB's) out of 36 various points of the Ganga river, the 27 points are found suitable for the propagation of wildlife and Fisheries. The dissolved oxygen (DO) values were found to 6.8 mg/ml from 3.8 mg/ml which is an improvement of 79%. Dissolved oxygen (DO) value and Biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels are also increased up to 30%. Ganga water at Haridwar and Rishikesh in India was investigated fit for drinking due to 500% decrease in sewage and industrial effluents as per CPCB assessment report. Domestic sewage, industrial waste, cloth washing near ghats, bathing, fairs and tourism activities were curtailed. At the same time, water is not being lifted by industries, so more flow in the river will dilute the pollutants. The study of water quality monitoring of the Ganga on April 19, 2020 by Central pollution control board (CPCB's) reveals the drinking water standards such as the BOD <3 mg/l, DO >4 mg/l, pH 6 to 9, ammonia 0.49 mg/l. Improvement in Ganga water is a function of quality and quantity. So it can be stated that COVID-19 lockdown will serve as a ventilator not only for the river but also for the entire environment and wildlife. Due to the restriction of human mobility, air pollution reduces up to 44%. Present studies will focus on various aspects of COVID-19 on global environmental pollution and wildlife.\n",

      "Gill-associated virus (GAV) infects Penaeus monodon shrimp and is the type species of the genus Okavirus in the Roniviridae, the only currently known invertebrate nidoviruses. In all other nidoviruses, the nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by a gene located near to the genome 3′-terminus and downstream of genes encoding other virion structural proteins [1]. However, in GAV and other genotypic variants in the yellow head virus (YHV) complex, the N protein is encoded in the ORF2 gene which resides immediately downstream of the 20 kb 5′-terminal ORF1a/1b replicase gene [2], [3]. The deduced molecular masses of the 144–146 amino acid (aa) N proteins of GAV and YHV (16.0–16.3 kDa) are lower than those estimated by SDS-PAGE (20–22 kDa), which for YHV has been reported to be due to a C-terminal cluster of acidic residues [3], [4]. Immuno-electron microscopy has confirmed that the N protein is the primary structural protein component of okavirus nucleocapsids [2], [5].\n",

      "Amongst strains of genotypes 1 (YHV), 2 (GAV), 3, 4 and 5 in the YHV complex [6], most amino acid variations (up to 17.2%) in the deduced N protein sequence occur in the highly charged N- and C-terminal domains [3], [6]. Nonetheless, the N proteins of GAV and YHV share common antigenic sites as evidenced by their cross-reactivity for a YHV N protein monoclonal antibody [5], [7] and polyclonal antiserum to a synthetic peptide designed to a C-terminal sequence of the GAV N protein [2]. As with the N proteins of coronaviruses and toroviruses [8], [9], the N proteins of GAV and YHV lack cysteine residues and are highly basic [2], [3]. It also possesses proline-rich and basic residue-rich domains likely to facilitate RNA binding as hypothesized for similar sequences in the N protein of toroviruses [2], [10]. The N protein length in okaviruses is intermediate to the corresponding proteins of arteriviruses (110–128 aa) and toroviruses (160–167 aa), and much shorter than the N protein of coronaviruses (377–454 aa) [2], [11], [12], [13], [14].\n",

      "Scientists are attempting to develop new potential therapeutic approaches to combat COVID-19. Some of these treatments involve the use of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, small-molecule drugs, interferon-based therapies, protease inhibitors, and adjunctive medications19. However, some medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are not recommended for use in the clinic, owing to reported toxicity and cardiovascular complications20. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of COVID-19. However, a recent study showed that it only reduces the time of clinical improvement and that there was no significant difference when compared with a placebo group19,21. Lopinavir/Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors, used for HIV treatment, were also not suggested because of harmful pharmacodynamics and insignificant clinical trial outcomes19. Though interferons are beneficial in the treatment of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, they lack efficacy against COVID-1922. Monoclonal antibodies were suggested as a therapeutic tool; however, they only provide protection against the early stage of the disease23. Adjunctive medications such as antimicrobial agents, corticosteroids, and ACE inhibitors are reported as a potential treatment; however, more clinical studies are required to clarify their mechanisms in COVID-1924. Hence, no pharmacological treatments efficiently stop disease progression.\n",

      "Studies on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 suggest that a dysregulated immune response occurs, resulting in extreme inflammation and deadly ARDS25 (Fig. 1). Thus, immunomodulation can be an efficient therapy. The safety and efficacy of MSCs have been presented in preclinical models of ARDS26, making them promising candidates for COVID-19. Moreover, the use of MSCs to treat patients with COVID-19 was safe and had no harmful effects14.

They are fibroblast-like cells; adhere to plastic substrates; express different clusters of differentiation (cell surface markers) CD90, CD105, CD29, CD44, CD54, CD166, Stro-1, and MHC-I; and express the absence of hematopoietic markers CD45, CD31, CD11b, CD19, CD34, CD14, and HLA-DR27,28. Owing to their attractive cell biology and roles in the field of tissue engineering, MSCs have been extensively explored over the past 30 years9. MSCs have a pioneering characteristic to differentiate intrinsically and release several beneficial growth factors and cytokines. MSCs possess effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that can treat inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions29. They have been reported to be safe and efficient for clinical application and their mechanism of action is well established30,31. MSC preconditioning with proinflammatory cytokines licenses the immunosuppressive activity by inducing the expression of anti-inflammatory factors32–34, reducing inflammation.\n",

      "Owing to the above-mentioned potential, MSCs are promising agents for the treatment of different tissue disorders9 and for the control of infectious diseases11. MSCs have antimicrobial properties that reduce acute lung injury (ALI) induced by bacterial infections35. MSCs improve the phagocytic function of host macrophages, leading to more effective eradication of bacteria35. Other reports also validate MSC therapy for malaria, a parasitic disease that causes severe destruction of red blood cells and anemia36. Gupta et al. demonstrated that transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells that did not express CCR5, the receptor to enter target immunological cells, could effectively cure HIV37. Earlier studies further showed that hematopoietic stem cells could be engineered to target HIV-infected cells38. Additionally, bone marrow–derived MSCs (BMMSCs) recover liver function in hepatitis B by regulating the Treg/Th17 cell balance39. In the lung, MSCs and their derived extracellular vesicles were shown to reduce the levels of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, decreasing the migration of inflammatory cells into the lungs. This can be a promising approach to cure ALI, which is induced by influenza viruses10,40. Improved oxygenation and decreased pulmonary edema were shown following the transplantation of human MSCs in ARDS in a sheep model41. MSCs have also been suggested for the treatment of the H7N9 viral infection that has similar clinical effects on the lung as COVID-1942. As noted, there are various sources from which MSCs can be isolated. However, bone marrow43 and adipose tissue44 are the most common adult tissue sources for MSCs. As a result, the infusion of adipose tissue–derived MSCs into patients with COVID-19 could improve the clinical outcomes and immunomodulatory functions in severe cases14. Human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs were used to treat patients with severe COVID-1945. Dental tissue–derived MSCs have also shown promise in tissue regeneration because of their potent capacities to differentiate into multiple lineages, immunomodulate, and secrete trophic factors. This collectively supports the use of MSCs as a potential treatment for COVID-19.\n",

      "Immunomodulation and Regenerative Properties of DPSCs ::: Introduction\n",
      "DPSCs, isolated from the pulp tissue, are the most common form of dental tissue–derived MSCs. Other stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), stem cells from apical papilla, periodontal ligament stem cells, and dental follicle precursor cells have also been reported46. DPSCs self-renew, are multipotent, and have unique biological properties that make them promising agents, capable of improving the endurance of affected tissues16 (Fig. 2). DPSCs have an effective immunomodulatory function that is able to address a diverse set of autoimmune and inflammation-related diseases47. The immunomodulatory mechanisms associated with the release of soluble factors, such as indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and human leukocyte antigen G5 (HLA-G5), and interfaces with immune cells such as B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages are hallmarks of their function48. DPSCs promote high expression of trophic factors such as PGE2, IL-6, and IDO49–51. A mixed lymphocyte reaction assay further revealed the strong enhancement of the immunosuppression of the DPSC-conditioned medium (CM)51. DPSCs inhibit the function of proinflammatory M1 macrophages by inhibiting the secretion of TNF-α via the IDO-mediated pathway52 (Fig. 2). They also polarize macrophages toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype through increased secretion of IL-10, PGE2, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)53. Furthermore, they have the capability to inhibit the activation of Th17 cells54 and stimulate the growth of CD25+, CD4+, and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells55. DPSCs also induce T cell apoptosis and inhibit the survival rate of NK cells and Th156, resulting in the reduced production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by Th1. At a level of humoral immunity, DPSCs hamper the proliferation, antibody production, and differentiation potential of B cells and inhibit the proliferation of allogeneic T and B cells by the release of TGF-β156. This secretion of TGF-β can suppress the activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells57.\n",

      "DPSCs play an important role in tissue regeneration58 and have the capability to repair different tissue disorders16. While BMMSCs are representative MSCs due to their high regenerative potential, DPSCs have higher angiogenic, neurogenic, and regenerative potential59, exhibiting an alternative multipurpose stem cell source for cellular therapies (Fig. 2). Neovascularization in the ischemic hindlimb has been demonstrated after DPSC transplantation60 (Fig. 3). The DPSC regeneration mechanisms via migration activity are achieved through modulating the response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), improving their regenerative potential51. Transplanted DPSCs produce a broad spectrum of cytokines and growth factors that modify neighboring cells. The success in restoring damaged tissues is in part related to the disclosure of paracrine factors in the host tissues. These paracrine effects promote the recruitment of progenitor cells, improve angiogenesis/neurogenesis, and modify the immune response61. The following paracrine factors are highly expressed in DPSCs, hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stromal cell-derived factor 1, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and a small number of cytokines (IL-6, -8, -10)61. The release of trophic factors following DPSC transplantation induces pulp regeneration, but the DPSCs themselves are not incorporated into the new tissue50. DPSCs differentiate into different cell types such as cardiomyocytes, melanocytes, myocytes, neurons, and hepatocyte-like cells16. BMMSCs and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) induce regenerated pulp tissue similar to DPSCs. The transplantation of DPSCs into pulpectomized teeth compared with BMMSCs or ADSCs resulted in the generation of a larger amount of pulp59. This can be explained by the increased release of trophic factors that promote angiogenesis, neurogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and chemotactic factors49. For these reasons, DPSCs are now considered as one of the best future sources of MSCs for use in regenerative medicine16. Thus, they are used to treat various tissue disorders, including dental, neurological, corneal, cardiovascular, hepatic, muscular dystrophy, pancreatic, and renal tissue diseases16,62,63. Moreover, the transplantation of allogeneic DPSCs (with matched and mismatched dog leukocyte antigen) into pulpectomized teeth of dogs regenerated pulp tissue in both matched and mismatched transplanted teeth. There was no toxicity or adverse event associated with the transplantation of DPSCs64. These results showed that DPSCs have high immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory, and tissue regeneration activities. Therefore, it is of interest in the development of COVID-19 treatment options (Fig. 2).\n",

      "Loss of alveolar structures and accumulation of inflammatory cells, followed by fibrosis, are the main characteristics of ARDS65. The activation of macrophages plays a role in the pathophysiology of ARDS66, where M1 macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines and increase tissue fibrosis67. Therefore, managing macrophages is a valuable strategy to treat ARDS. Wakayama et al. showed that intravenous infusion of SHED and their CM were assessed in chemically induced ALI in a mouse model. The results showed that the survival rate and regeneration improved after the administration of either SHED or CM. Moreover, this treatment upregulated the anti-inflammatory effect by activating M2 macrophages68. In COVID-19, the reported clinical studies used the intravenous injection of MSCs as a satisfactory and less invasive method. Fortunately, MSCs injected intravenously are trapped mostly in the lungs, the most affected organ in COVID-19, and to a smaller extent in other tissues69. This suggests that intravenous administration of DPSCs will be localized to the lung tissues. Compared with other sources of MSCs, DPSCs exhibit higher potential for treating COVID-19 for the following reasons:DPSCs can be easily isolated in a less invasive manner from discarded teeth and comply with ethical considerations70.DPSCs are abundantly available, are easy to harvest, and have effective therapeutic abilities49,71,72.\n",
      "In vitro, they show a high proliferative ability73, provide sufficient cell numbers in a short period. Besides, demonstrated a multi-differentiation potential46.DPSCs and SHED have immunomodulatory functions similar to those of BMMSCs.

To overcome these challenges, immortalized DPSCs have been developed74. The piggyBac system, composed of mutant baculovirus strains derived from the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni, was used to immortalize DPSCs75. Orimoto et al. transduced a mutant cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4R24C), cyclin D1, and telomerase reverse transcriptase into DPSCs to establish an immortalized DPSC cell line with a high proliferative rate74.

Moreover, DPSCs can regenerate and reconstruct damaged tissues via reparative properties and effects of trophic factors (Fig. 2). Currently, there are many clinical trials using MSCs from different sources to treat COVID-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Two of the early recorded trials used DPSCs (Table 1). A protocol for a clinical trial by Ye et al. to assess the safety and efficiency of DPSCs from allogeneic donors in severe cases of COVID-19 was recently published77. The study reported on the safety and efficacy of DPSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. The time consumed for clinical improvement and the improvement of laboratory tests such as blood tests, liver and kidney functions, inflammatory markers, and immunological tests influenced the outcomes of the study77. However, the specific underlying mechanisms and outcomes of these trials are still not clear. Going forward, the appropriate cell dosage and concentration should be optimized to increase the efficacy and safety of DPSC-based COVID-19 therapies.\n",

Section 4 combines both towards generic quantitative admissibility and an intrinsic complexity-theoretic Main Theorem. The key is to consider metric properties of the inverse of a representation, which is inherently multivalued a ‘function’. To this end Sect. 3 adopts from [PZ13] a notion of quantitative (uniform) continuity multifunctions (Subsect. 3.1) and establishes important properties (Subsect. 3.2), including closure under a generalized conception of restriction.

Coronaviruses are well known for their ability to mutate rapidly, alter tissue tropism, cross the species barrier, and adapt to different epidemiological situations [1]. Six human coronaviruses have been reported since the 1960s; four of them (OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1) cause mild illness similar to the common cold and gastrointestinal tract infection. The other two, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have raised significant public health concerns due to their zoonotic emergence and crossing of the species barrier, causing high pathogenicity and mortality in humans [2]. SARS- and MERS-CoVs were reported to be transmitted from the main host (bats) to palm civets or dromedary camels, respectively, then finally to humans [3,4,5]. Both SARS- and MERS-CoVs were and are highly pathogenic, resulting in 8096 and 2519 human cases, with 9.6% and 34.3% fatality rate in 2003–2004 and 2012–present, respectively [6,7].\n",

Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 forms a distinct lineage with Bat-SARS-like coronaviruses that belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, and subgenus Sarbecovirus [9]. SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.3%, 89%, and 82% nucleotide similarity with bat CoV RaTG13, SARS-like CoV ZXC21, and SARS-CoV, respectively, which confirms its zoonotic origin [10,11].\n",

Studying wildfire dynamics is done by collecting data [3] and combining wildfire simulation tools with experimental data to assimilate or adjust the widfire simulation [11–14]. Previous work on data assimilation using the farsite [7] wildfire simulation tool combined with ensemble Kalman filtering can be found in [5, 16]. Next to large body of work that use some form of Kalman filtering, [2, 4, 8, 10] there are alternative approaches that use Genetic Algorithms to determine the best set of input parameters to match the measurements [1].

      "To improve the quality of wildfire prediction and to speed up computations, one piece of critical information is often neglected in wildfire data assimilation: stationary points at which a (part of the) fire perimeter remains at the same locations between periodic updates. Clearly, those points can be characterized with a relatively high accuracy and do not require computational updates. In terms of data assimilation, such stationary points can be viewed as constrains in a constrained Ensemble Kalman Filtering [15] formulation. Fortunately, the farsite [7] wildfire simulation tool has the notion of barrier points to account for stationary fire perimeters. Identifying such stationary or barrier points on the fire perimeter and combining this information with ensemble Kalman filtering is the main contribution of this paper.\n",

Estimation of these input parameters along with the identification of barrier points further improve the periodic prediction of fire perimeters.

Since then, enteric infections in humans caused by astrovirus have been reported worldwide mainly in infants and young children.

      "The name astrovirus derives from the Greek word “astron” (=star) and describes the characteristic five/six pointed star-like projections detectable by negative stained EM of the virions. Although it should be pointed out that the presence of these projections is pH dependent and may only be present in less than 10% of the population (Caul and Appleton, 1982, Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002). In fact, in some instances the typical star-like appearance is not easily recognizable in EM preparations and astroviruses could be misidentified as enteroviruses or provisionally named astrovirus-like particles or small round viruses (SRVs) (Guy et al., 2004, Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002). This was probably the case of astrovirus infections in ducks, turkeys, and guinea fowl, where picornavirus or enterovirus-like particles were initially described (Cattoli et al., 2005, Guy et al., 2004, Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002). For this reason, the advent of more specific tools for virus detection and genome-based identification in the last ten years has allowed the discovery or the confirmation of the presence of astroviruses in a number of different hosts.\n",

The first reports in animals were from lambs and calves suffering from diarrhea (Snodgrass and Gray, 1977, Woode and Bridger, 1978). Based on clinical and virological observations during acute mortality cases in ducks in the 1980s, the presence of astrovirus was associated with fatal hepatitis (Gough et al., 1984). This was perhaps the first evidence of extra-intestinal localization of astroviruses. Of interest, similar acute duck hepatitis was also reported in the 1960s, one decade before the discovery of astrovirus in humans and 20 years before identification of astroviruses as the cause of hepatitis in ducks (Asplin, 1965a, Asplin, 1965b). At present, the list of animal species susceptible to astrovirus infection has expanded to include domestic, synantropic and wild animals, avian and mammalian species in the terrestrial and aquatic environments (Table 1\n",
      "). In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the identification of astroviruses in new animal species due to the advent of better molecular assays and pathogen discovery tools.

      "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), first described in the 1930s in the USA (Schalk & Hawn, 1931), is a coronavirus of chickens (Gallus gallus). IBV is a highly contagious virus and in addition to causing respiratory and kidney diseases can affect the reproductive organs, resulting in loss of production and poor egg quality (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008). IBV belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales and to the genus of the gamma-coronavirus (Gonzalez et al., 2003). It has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The 3′ end of the genome encodes four structural proteins—spike (S), envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid—and small non-structural proteins (Cavanagh, 2007). The spike is formed by post-translational cleavage of two parts, S1 and S2. The carboxy-terminal S2 subunit is a conserved structure found in coronaviruses of different species that anchors S1 to the viral envelope and is also responsible for membrane fusion (Cavanagh, 2007). The amino-terminal subunit S1 is important in viral attachment and is a major virus-neutralizing antibody site (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Casais et al., 2003). S1 contains hypervariable regions that are able to change very easily through mutation or recombination (Kusters et al., 1990; Cavanagh et al., 1992). The molecular identification of IBV is based mainly on the analysis of the S1 protein gene (De Wit, 2000).\n",

Infectious bronchitis (IB) can be managed through sound biosecurity principles and vaccination. However, control by vaccination is difficult because of antigenic variation in the virus. Outbreaks of the disease can occur even in vaccinated flocks following small changes to the amino acids in the S1 protein of IBV, which can result in a decrease in cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1992). However, in some cases there is a high level of cross-protection against other strains with a low homology, for which the term protectotype was introduced (Dhinakar Raj & Jones, 1996; Cook et al., 1999). To date, many different genotypes of IBV have been identified.

After a few years, in April 2011, an outbreak of IB was reported in a layer flock. Since then, a series of outbreaks have been reported in broiler parent flocks, in layer flocks and also in backyard chicken flocks. The objective of the study was to investigate the distribution of avian IBV in a non-vaccinating country (Finland) and also to carry out molecular characterization of IBV isolates in Finland.\n",
